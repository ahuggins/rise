# Rise

I wanted to learn a bit about Elixir and the Phoenix framework, so this is just me playing around. If you clone locally, you'll need to setup local things with these commands:

```
cp config/dev.exs.example config/dev.exs  # creates the project's configuration file
mix deps.get  # installs the dependencies
mix ecto.create  # creates the database.
mix ecto.migrate  # run the database migrations.
mix phx.server  # run the application.
```

### Run migrations with:

`mix ecto.migrate` (assuming you have Elixir already installed)






## Standard Generated Docs

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
